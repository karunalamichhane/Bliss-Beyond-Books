    <h1>**Bliss Beyond Books**</h1>
    <h2>The Author </h2>
Books have always been a part of my life, even if it lay there on the floor untouched. When I was little I never understood the fascination between letters coming together to form something bigger. Staring at words felt like such a tedious task when reading was assigned to me during elementary school. That was until 6th grade when everything changed. We had these reading goals that we had to accomplish by the end of the school year and I was determined to finish it. During one of the reading period. my friend lent me something to read. I mean I couldn't just sit there and do nothing, so I caved in and agreed. That day, something changed magically, and I still do not know if it because I enjoyed the genre of the book, but I was completey and utterly enthralled. From then reading has been a hobby of mine that I hope continues to develop as I grow old. You might be wondering what this magical book may be that changed eveyrthing and I am a bit hestiate to say because looking at it now it is not the best boook ever. but it's called "Addie's Bell SHortut to Growingup".
